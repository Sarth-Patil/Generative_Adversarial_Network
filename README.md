# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) consists of two deep neural networks,  
"The Discriminator" and "The Generator", competing against one another (adversarial).

Discriminative algorithms predict label given the features of an instance of data,  
p(y|x) the probability of y (label) given x (features).

Generative algorithms predict (generate) features given a label or category,  
p(x|y)  the probability of x (features) given y (label).

## Generator - 
Is a generative algorithm which generates new data instances from random noise (fake data).

## Discriminator -
Is a discriminative algorithm which tries to discriminate between real and fake data generated by the generator  
(evaluates data for authenticity).
